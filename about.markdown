Angels Landing is a one-stop source of family trip information.
Founded in 2022 by a mother of two boys,
Angels Landing caters to parents wanting to explore outdoor lives,
but without trials and errors.

To this end, at Angels Landing we share experiences, recommendations,
and practical advices â€“ both for those new to outdoor life
and for those wanting to bring theirs to the next level.
